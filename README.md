# Notes and Formula Sheets

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my lecture notes, formula sheets, and cheat sheets. These documents were compiled and shared with my peers at the [Department of Bioengineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/bioengineering), Imperial College London as part of my undergraduate studies (2019-2023) and teaching assistant work (2021-present).
